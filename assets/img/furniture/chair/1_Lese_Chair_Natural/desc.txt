The Lese chair is a minimalistic, interlocking, puzzle structure. The unnecessary elements in the construction are avoided, thus emphasizing on the unique shape. Ergonomics is provided by specific inclines in all directions. The hardwood beech legs give strength but also redirect to the classical chairs from the past. The seat and the back are produced from transparent, extremely strong polycarbonate, which allow the beauty of the construction to remain visible.*/Permanent collection./ ; */FREE worldwide standard shipping.
