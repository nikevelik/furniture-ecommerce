Arch chair is the designer tribute to the 50’s and 60’s popular stackable chairs. A leather membrane is used for the seating and backrest that contributes to the user's comfort. The debut of the Arch Series was held at Stockholm Furniture&Light Fair 2017 when Lock became the first Bulgarian company to be presented at the world's biggest gathering for Scandinavian design.
